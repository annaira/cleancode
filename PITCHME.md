### Motivation​

- Encapsulation is good! We make our variables private so there is little dependence on them, and we are free to change the implementation!​
- But then we add getters and setters....​
        ​
  
      Getters and Setters​
  
               vs​
  
           Encapsulation​

@[1-4](The implementation is completely exposed)

?gist=annaira/effa6cad2cc1e04cfa0ed8719d314e7a&lang=Java&title=Abstract Point

@[1-8](The implementation is completely hidden)
